# Mechatronics
All of the Arduino programming created during our Mechatronics course in college. Besides some of the other labs, the main focus of the course was to create. design, build, and program a robot to pick up small wooden balls, detect their color, and sort them into two separate zones. 

DOUBLE_BUTTON_CHALLENGE:
Our team was assigned to create a program that would play two seperate songs when two different buttons were pressed. The catch was that the Arduino had to constantly be listening for input from the buttons and queue songs while playing the song it was currently on. 

PLATFORM_MOVEMENT_TEST:
Simple program used to test if the motors on the robot were working and oriented correctly. 
PrelabExcersisesTaskII was the same as Platform movemnt test.

PRELABEXERCISESTASKIII:
Arduino was tasked to count in binary and then output it to the four different outputs. Was an excercise in Binary. 

ALEX_STEIN_PNEUMATIC_ONE_BALL_STATE:
Tasked with programming an arduino connect to a complecated hydraulic machine to move two ball around in a circuit. Arduino used sensors to sense when the ball got into a certain location. Had to keep two balls from hitting each other and without any delay. Used state machine concept to achive goal.
